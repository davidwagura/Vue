"Vue"
<h2>About the website</h2>
The end goal of creating this website is to  reduce the amount of time wasted inputting and calculating average scores in learning institutions.
<h2>Technologies used</h2>
The Technologies that I used when working on the project were:
* HTML and CSS
 I learned these technologies in the following sources :
  *  Freecodecamp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Freecodecamp.com</a> and
  *  W3 schools <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3 schools.com</a>
* JavaScript(Vue)
I learned JavaScript(Vue) from freecodecamp  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.com</a>and I was also assisted by Software Engineer Felex Kemboi  <a href="https://github.com/felexkemboi">github.com</a>
